    title: "<br />On Ramp to Clouds"
    url: 'http://mycloudmesh.org'
    text: 'Cloudmesh can be used as an on-ramp to clouds and even HPC services. This makes it possible to use Azure, AWS, OpenStack, and other clouds as well as HPC batch systems in the same framework easily.'

    title: "<br /><br />Cloudmesh Shell"
    url: 'http://cloudmesh.github.io/introduction_to_cloud_computing/cloudmesh/overview.html#cloudmesh-shell'
    text: 'For experiment management it os often not sufficient to
	just provide a GUI interface but to be able to script how virtual
	machines are coordinated. This can be done with our cloudmesh
	shell that similar to matlab has its own shell environment, but
	can also be simply be called as a command on a regular Linux
	terminal. The Cloudmesh Shell services interfaces with the Task
	and Database Services.'

widget-3:
    title: "Federated GUI"
    url: 'https://github.com/Phlow/feeling-responsive'
    text: 'While other clouds focus on their own infrastructure,
	Cloudmesh provides a user interface with federation capabilities
	to display and interact with heterogeneous clouds. In addition
	information between these clouds is not hidden behind a
	compatibility library such as libcloud or a cloud standard, but
	uses instead the natively available information. This allows
	developers to interact and inspect information on a different
	level than just being able to start and stop virtual
	machines. Interfaces to HPC queues are also available. The Web
	services interfaces with the Task and Database Services.'
