## Cloudmesh in Classes

Cloudmesh can be used in classes to simplify several activities that
occur repeatedly as part of interacting with clouds:

1. Cloudmesh allows to use multiple clouds at the same time
2. The Cloudmsh shell allows stateful interactions with clouds
   reducing time to interface with the cloud, but also saving
   resources while interfacing with a local database of virtual
   machines. Updates are done on requests.
3. Cloudmesh provides simple command tools to launch
    a. virtual clusters
	b. hadoop clusters

## Usage

Cloudmesh has been used in multiple classes at IU to simplify access
to clouds and staging of virtual clusters. 

Students have ben able to add new cloudmesh commands while leveraging
our easy to use templates to extend the cloudmesh command shell. A good
example is the creation of an apache spark cluster with the help of
cloudmesh.
